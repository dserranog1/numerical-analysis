# Numerical analysis

A repository for proposed exercises in the course numerical analysis at the National University of Colombia (Manizales) on 2024-2

## Overview

This project is managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and packaging. It primarily uses Jupyter Notebooks for development and analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later  
- [Poetry installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)  

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dserranog1/numerical-analysis.git
   cd numerical-analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install all dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

## Usage

1. **Select the Poetry kernel:**
   - Open a notebook file or create a new one.
   - In the Jupyter toolbar, go to `Kernel > Change Kernel`.
   - Select the kernel you created, e.g., `Python (poetry-env)`.

2. **Run your notebooks:**
   Start executing cells using the selected kernel.
